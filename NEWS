2017-02-25: Version 0.6
-----------------------

Addded

 - File output instead of only playback (`espeak.init(playing=False)`).
 - Support for multiple instances of speakers (the `espeak.Espeak` class). They have to take turns and *not* simultaneously speak.
 - Support for multiple callbacks (`espeak.add_callback`).
 - Wave file content sent through callbacks (for `playing=False` only since this is how the C library works).
 - Optional start and end position for synthesis.
 - Slightly more uniform bindings in some places (`espeak.const`).

The API is however significantly changed and not backwards compatible.

-----------------------

 - Added support for Python 3.
 - Minor fixes (eg. compiler warnings).

2012-01-01: Version 0.4
-----------------------

 - Fixed a possible deadlock.

2011-02-20: Version 0.3
-----------------------

 - Fixed set_voice (parameters were being parsed incorrectly).

2011-01-23: Version 0.2
-----------------------

 - Fixed a memory allocation bug in synth() which resulted in weird stuff
   being spoken out (LP: #580781).
 - Exposed the SSML, phonemes, endpause and user_data options in synth().
 - Wrapped all Parameter constants into a class.
 - Added classes with constant definitions for Punctuation and Gender.
 - Made the 'relative' argument of set_parameter() optional.
